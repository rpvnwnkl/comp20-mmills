# The README File

## Each assignment and lab shall include a README file that describes the work. This description must:

> 1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

all aspects have been implemented as described:

Inside of the *lyrics* div I've annotated the video, in time, with the lyrics themselves. I did this with Javascript and then added some styling with *CSS*.
However, I haven't presented the lyric text grouped by Stanza, but by line. Depending on your interpretation of the assignment, this could be wrong.

> 1. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

No collaborators, but some ideas and code inspirations were drawn from elsewhere on the web. The source code features comments when specific material has been referenced.

> 2. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

   4 hrs 

> 3. Be written in either text format (**README.txt**) or in Markdown (**README.md**). Markdown is preferred. No other formats will be accepted. Please use all capital letters for README
