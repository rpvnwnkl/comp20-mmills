# The README File

## Each assignment and lab shall include a README file that describes the work. This description must:

> ```1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.```

The map is drawn on the page, markers are put out at each station with a custom icon, and a red polyline is drawn along the train route. 
   
> ``` 1. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.```

No collaborators, but some ideas and code inspirations were drawn from elsewhere on the web. The source code features comments when specific material has been referenced.

> ```2. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.```

4 hrs, plus another hour and a half messing with formatting all these submissions...

> ```3. Be written in either text format (**README.txt**) or in Markdown (**README.md**). Markdown is preferred. No other formats will be accepted. Please use all capital letters for README```
