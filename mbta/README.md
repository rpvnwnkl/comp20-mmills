# The README File

## Each assignment and lab shall include a README file that describes the work. This description must:

> ```1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.```

The map is drawn on the page, markers are put out at each station with a custom icon, and a red polyline is drawn along the train route. 
Your location is gathered from the browser, or a dummy location is used if location services aren't enabled. You location is mapped with a custom icon.
Upon clicking on your icon, an infowindow is created that shows the distance in miles to the nearest station. A blue polyline is drawn to the nearest station.
Upon clicking on any of the station icons, an infowindow is created showing the next incoming trains, and their direction.

There was a good deal more I was interested in doing, but I didn't end up having the time as I got stuck on learning more about the asynchronous nature of javascript.
   
> ``` 1. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.```

No collaborators, but some ideas and code inspirations were drawn from elsewhere on the web. The source code features comments when specific material has been referenced. Besides your posts on Piazza, I found the following link helpful for understanding call back functions: http://recurial.com/programming/understanding-callback-functions-in-javascript/

> ```2. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.```

I honestly lost track, but I've been working on this for several days, several hours each. My first guess is around 16 hours, but it might be closer to 10 or 12.

> ```3. Be written in either text format (**README.txt**) or in Markdown (**README.md**). Markdown is preferred. No other formats will be accepted. Please use all capital letters for README```
